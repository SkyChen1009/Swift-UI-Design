## Features
**1. Page Navigation**
  - Pages: There are two main pages: the Home page and the Search page.
  - Scroll View: Both pages feature scrollable content, allowing users to swipe down to explore more items.

    - We Are…
    - 眠月線
      
  - *Functionality:* Each button opens a playlist view, displaying a list of songs that users can scroll through. The top left back button returns to the Home page.
  - *Animations:* Button interactions and scrolling animations use the ease in - out effect, adding smooth transitions.

**3. Tab View**

  - *Design:* The Tab View is a semi-transparent gray box with rounded corners.
  - *Navigation:* The first button navigates to the Home page, while the second button directs to the Search page.

  - *Exit Option:* Users can exit the sheet by pressing the “X” button in the top right corner.
